# Elaboration: For Opensea

- First of all I had gone through the design and find that is there any element that I can reuse or not.
- After analysing whole design I started working with the Reactjs as I can reuse the code in it.
- As the use of 3rd party library is prohibted, I had to develop my own slider that is as not good as the one used in the original site. But I had tried my best replicate it.
- For the data, I had made a json file for stroring images links and other informations so that i don't have to save those in locally as it will increase the file size.
- In original site icons are used from the external libraries. But I had downloaded most related png to them.
- Most of the element present in the website are similar to each other so I had created the components for them and reused that code.
